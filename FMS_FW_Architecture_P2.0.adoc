== Background

This document provides the detailed software architecture for a system designed to acquire data from multiple pumps in a pump station. The system uses an Arduino-based ESP32 microcontroller to communicate with pumps via either RS485 or a hardware multiplexer connected to UART2. Data collected from pumps, such as price, total liters dispensed, and other critical metrics, is transmitted to a remote MQTT server. If the server is unavailable, the data along with error codes are logged into the SDCard and synchronized with the server when communication is restored.

The architecture supports device configuration through a command-line interface (CLI) over UART1 and a user-friendly local web server. Critical device settings, including pump IDs, WiFi credentials, and server configurations, are stored persistently in the SDCard and loaded during device boot-up.

== Requirements

=== Must-Have
1. The system must read data from pumps using UART2 through either RS485 or a hardware multiplexer.
2. The system must provide a CLI for configuration via UART1.
3. The system must host a local web server for device configuration.
4. Configuration settings such as device IDs, WiFi credentials, and pump information must be stored in the SDCard and loaded at boot-up.
5. Data from pumps must be sent to an MQTT server in real time.
6. When the server is unavailable, data and error codes must be logged into the SDCard.
7. Logged data must be synchronized with the server when communication is restored.

=== Should-Have
1. The web server should have password protection for security.
2. The system should support secure MQTT communication (e.g., TLS/SSL).

=== Could-Have
1. The system could store additional logs for detailed troubleshooting.
2. The system could support over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates.

=== Wonâ€™t-Have
1. Advanced protocols like Modbus or CAN will not be included in the initial release.
2. High-speed analytics or streaming capabilities will not be implemented on the device.

== Method

=== System Overview
The system is designed with the following key components:
- **Arduino-based Microcontroller**: Manages communication and processing.
- **Hardware Multiplexer** or **RS485**: Allows communication with pumps through UART2.
- **SDCard**: Stores persistent configuration data, logs data when the server is unavailable, and error codes.
- **MQTT Communication**: Sends pump data to the server.
- **Web Server and CLI**: Provide configuration interfaces.

=== Device Configuration Parameters
- **Device ID**: Unique identifier for the device.
- **Station ID**: Identifier for the pump station.
- **WiFi SSID/Password**: WiFi network credentials.
- **MQTT Server IP/Port**: Server details for data transmission.
- **Pump Count/IDs**: Details of connected pumps.
- **Multiplexer Control Pins**: GPIO pin configuration for pump communication (if using Multiplexer).
- **RS485 Configuration**: Communication settings for RS485 (if used).
- **Debug Flags**: Enable/disable debugging.
- **Boot Counter**: Tracks device reboots.

=== Communication Modules
- **UART1 (CLI)**: Used for device configuration via a command-line interface.
- **UART2 (Multiplexer or RS485)**: Used for polling data from pumps via either the multiplexer or RS485, depending on the configuration.

=== MQTT Communication
- Sends pump data to the server in predefined data structure format.
- Ensures reliable delivery through retry mechanisms.

=== SDCard Configuration
- Persistent storage for all configuration settings.
- Logs data and error codes when the server is unavailable.
- Synchronizes logged data back to the server when communication is restored.

=== Web Server
- Hosts a user-friendly HTTP interface.
- Allows users to configure the device securely.

**Key Information**

1. **Configuration Settings:**
- Configuration data is read from the SDCard during the boot-up phase.
- If no configuration is available, default settings are loaded.
2. **Data Logging:**
- When the server is unavailable, logs (data and error codes) are stored on the SDCard.
3. **Data Sync:**
- When communication is restored, logged data is sent back to the server.
4. **CLI Configuration Update:**
- Commands from UART1 can update configuration settings, which are written back to the SDCard.
5. **Error Handling:**
- Errors are logged to the SDCard for debugging and tracking purposes.
6. **Task-Oriented Design:**
- Tasks like WiFi, SDCard, and SPI handle their specific roles independently, ensuring modularity and concurrency.

=== Algorithms
1. **Polling Algorithm**:
   - **Multiplexer Mode**:
     - Iterate over pumps connected via the multiplexer.
     - Select the appropriate pump by controlling GPIO pins.
     - Communicate with the selected pump via UART2 using RS232 commands.
     - Parse the received data and validate the response.
     - Log any errors to the SDCard.
   - **RS485 Mode**:
     - Send RS485 requests to all pumps or targeted devices based on the protocol.
     - Wait for pump responses and parse received data.
     - Log errors for timeouts or protocol violations to the SDCard.

2. **Publishing Algorithm**:
   - Aggregate collected data into a data structure.
   - Publish the data to the MQTT server.
   - If the MQTT server is unavailable, log the data into the SDCard for retry.

3. **Configuration Synchronization**:
   - During boot-up, load configuration from the SDCard.
   - Validate the configuration data for completeness and consistency.
   - Apply configuration to the system and write updates back to the SDCard if modified.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Log errors, such as communication timeouts or invalid responses, to the SDCard.
   - Attempt retries for failed operations.
   - Notify the server of critical errors via MQTT when connectivity is restored.

5. **Data Recovery**:
   - On server reconnection, retrieve unsent data from the SDCard.
   - Synchronize the logged data with the server to ensure no loss of information.

=== FreeRTOS Task Management
- **WiFi Task**: Manages MQTT connection and reconnection logic.
- **Polling Task**:
  - Operates in either RS485 or multiplexer mode, depending on configuration.
  - Acquires pump data and hands it off for logging or publishing.
- **SDCard Task**: Handles configuration reads/writes and error logging.
- **Web Server Task**: Responds to HTTP requests for configuration changes.
- **CLI Task**: Processes UART1 commands for real-time configuration updates.

== Implementation

=== Step 1: Hardware Setup
1. Connect pumps to the multiplexer inputs.
2. Configure GPIO pins for multiplexer or connect RS485 hardware.
3. Connect the SDCard to the ESP32 via SPI.

=== Step 2: Firmware Development
1. Write code to initialize UART1, UART2, GPIO, and SPI.
2. Implement FreeRTOS tasks for WiFi, SDCard, CLI, and polling.

=== Step 3: Testing and Debugging
1. Verify UART and SPI communication.
2. Test MQTT data publishing and SDCard logging.

=== Step 4: Deployment
1. Flash the firmware onto the ESP32.
2. Deploy the system in a live pump station and monitor performance.

== Milestones

1. **Initial Setup**: Complete hardware connections and communication tests.
2. **Firmware Development**: Implement all modules and FreeRTOS tasks.
3. **MQTT Communication**: Test publishing and error handling.
4. **System Integration**: Combine all components and verify interactions.
5. **Deployment and Testing**: Install the system at a pump station and validate reliability.

== Gathering Results

1. **Functional Testing**: Verify data acquisition and publishing.
2. **Communication Testing**: Validate stability of RS485 and MQTT communication.
3. **Performance Metrics**: Measure response times for data polling and publishing.
4. **Usability Testing**: Evaluate the web interface and CLI for ease of use.
5. **Deployment Validation**: Assess real-world operation and collect stakeholder feedback.
